# makers99/wp-cli-db-export-clean

Adds the WP-CLI command `wp db export-clean` to create a MySQL database dump
without sensitive data related to customers and optionally API secrets/credentials,
while retaining all administrative users and their related data.

Revisions are excluded as well to minimize the dump file size.

## Usage

```
wp db export-clean [<filepath>] [--remove-keys]
```

### Arguments

The command accepts the result filename as argument. If omitted, it defaults to
`./clean.sql`.

### Options

|Option|Description|Default|
|------|-----------|-------|
|`--remove-keys`|Additionally remove options containing license keys and API credentials during dump.|`false`|


### Examples

- Create clean database dump in `./clean.sql`:
    ```console
    $ wp db export-clean
    ```

- Create clean database dump in the user's home directory:
    ```console
    $ wp db export-clean ~/clean.sql
    ```

- Exclude plugin license keys and API keys in the clean database dump â€“ useful when working with plugin vendor support or unknown freelancers:
    ```console
    $ wp db export-clean --remove-keys
    ```




## Integration

### Including more users in the database export

The `wp db export-clean` command only includes all users having the role administrator by default. Use the filter hook `'wp-db-export-clean/allowed-emails'` to add more users:
```php
add_filter('wp-db-export-clean/allowed-emails', function ($allowed_emails) {
  global $wpdb;
  $users = $wpdb->get_col(
    $wpdb->prepare("SELECT u.user_email FROM {$wpdb->prefix}users u WHERE u.user_email LIKE '%%%s'", '@example.com')
  );
  return array_unique(array_merge($allowed_emails, $users));
});
```
